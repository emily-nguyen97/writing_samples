# Writing Samples

Welcome! I'm Emily, and this is my collection of writing samples for technical writing. The readme lists my samples and includes the tools I used for them.

# Academic Writing

This section contains my writing from my graduate studies in computational engineering. 

## ANODE Summary

I wrote a summary for a research paper on augmented neural ordinary differential equations. You can check out the [raw latex file](AcademicWriting/anode_main.tex) and the [pdf](AcademicWriting/anode_main.pdf).

Tools:
- LaTeX for authoring
- pdflatex for compiling 

> [!NOTE]
> For this portfolio, I learned how to compile LaTeX files in the terminal instead of using Overleaf. I ran the following code:

```bash
# Install pdflatex
apt-get update
apt install texlive-latex-base

# Compile with pdflatex
pdflatex anode_main.tex
```
